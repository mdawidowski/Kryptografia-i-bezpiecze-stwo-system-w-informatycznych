The Polish Hussars, were one of the main types of the cavalry in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
between the 16th and 18th centuries. When this cavalry type was first introduced by the Serbian and
Hungarian mercenary horsemen at the beginning of the 16th century, they served as light cavalry banners
in the Polish army; by the second half of the 16th century and after Stephen Bathory's reforms, hussars
had been transformed into heavily armored shock cavalry. Until the reforms of the 1770s, the husaria
banners were considered the elite of the Polish cavalry.
