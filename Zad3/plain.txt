to be or not to be that is the question
whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer 
the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
or to take arms against a sea of troubles
and by opposing end them to die to sleep
no more and by a sleep to say we end
the heartache and the thousand natural shocks 
that flesh is heir to tis a consummation
devoutly to be wishd to die to sleep
to sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub
for in that sleep of death what dreams may come
when we have shuffled off this mortal coil 
must give us pause theres the respect
that makes calamity of so long life
for who would bear the whips and scorns of time
th oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely
the pangs of despisd love the laws delay 
the insolence of office and the spurns
that patient merit of th unworthy takes
when he himself might his quietus make
